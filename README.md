## Contributing
We already have some features that we want to develop, so you can pick an open issue created by [@alexandrejacarvalho](http://github.com/alexandrejacarvalho) that has `TODO` prefix on them.

New suggestions for improvement and Pull Requests are welcome! We want to improve the system as much as possible at a certain point that it can predict good movements on the market and do markets actions itself ;)

Open an issue with what you would like to change and we will happily discuss the idea :)

The bot is on my personal Discord, you can join it if you want to talk to me or just to chat with the bot.
